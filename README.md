# AQI_Prediction

Air Quality Index (AQI) prediction using Random Forest Regression.

## Project Overview
This project is part of the *Naan Mudhalvan* initiative and aims to predict AQI levels using machine learning techniques.

## Methodology
After thorough testing of multiple algorithms, **Random Forest Regression** was chosen due to its superior accuracy. The decision was supported by insights from the research paper:  
[Prediction of Air Quality Index Using Machine Learning Techniques: A Comparative Analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/4916267).

## Why Random Forest?
Various machine learning models were evaluated, but **Random Forest Regression** consistently yielded the highest prediction accuracy, making it the best choice for this project.
